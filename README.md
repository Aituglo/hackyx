Hackyx is a search engine for cybersecurity.

It is built for the community so anyone can add a new content to it.

The aim of this project is to easily find any resource related to IT security like CTF writeup, article or Bug Bounty reports.

### Add a new content

To add a new content, you simply have to fill the form on the main website [https://hackyx.io](https://hackyx.io).

You can find it at the bottom of the page "Add a new content".

Then, a manual review will be done to validate the content. If it's validated, the content will be added to the search engine.

## TODO

- [x] Add a filter by tags
- [x] Add a filter by type of content
